            <h4>Who are we?</h4>
            <p>The Passage Environmental Group was set up in 2010.  We are a group of volunteers living in the Passage West area, who meet once a week to discuss environmental issues impacting Passage.
               We are a diverse group including various nationalities; our members are students, parents and pensioners who all share a common interest in 
               protecting our environment.
            </p>
            <h4>Our Mission</h4>
            <p>Our mission can be summed up in our motto <q>Doing our bit for the planet in Passage!</q>. We are passionate about the area we live in and about protecting the
               environment. Given the huge environmental challenges the world is facing today, it is sometimes hard to know what changes you can do to make a difference.
               We in the Passage Environmental Group believe as the saying goes <q>charity begins in the home</q> and home for us is Passage.  By each of us doing our 
               little bit for the environment, we can make Passage a nice place to live not just for ourselves but the generations to come.
