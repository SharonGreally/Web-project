            <h4>Did you know...</h4>
            <p>Passage West (or Passage as it is known to us locals) is located 11km from Cork City on the west bank of Cork Harbour.  We are
               passionate about the area we live in and want to raise awareness and educate locals on the small steps they can 
               take in their everyday lives to help our environment.
            </p>
            <h4>Did you know...</h4>
            <p> Our Recycling Bins are located in the Passage Library carpark.  Bring your glass bottles and cans here to have them recycled. There are 
               also two charity bins which take old clothes and books so why not bring these along too.  As well as helping the environment, you will be helping the charities 
               raise much needed funds.
            </p>
            <h4>Did you know...</h4>
            <p> You can cycle from Passage into Cork City along Cork Harbour Greenway but there are many more Cycling/Walking trails to choose from.  So why not ditch the car and take to one of the many Cycling/Walking Trails 
               Passage has to offer.  As well as reducing your carbon footprint, it's a great way to exercise and enjoy the outdoors. 
            </p>
            <h4>Did you know...</h4>
            <p> There is a Grow Your Own Garden project in Passage.  This is a great way to grow your own healthy nutritious food while cutting down on the 
               amount of plastic that is brought home from supermarkets every day. Check out the YouTube video below on how you too can start growing your own food.
